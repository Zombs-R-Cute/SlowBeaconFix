# Slow Beacon Fix
### Large & Insane maps(Rio, Amio) sometimes have beacon spawning issues where it takes hour(s) to finish a single horde beacon.
#### This fixes it by spawning multiple zombies at one time.

Configuration options:
- Debug: True/False - Displays stats about the area
- MaximumZombiesToSpawn: 0 - 100 - selectable maximum number of zombies to spawn at each update, as long as it's less than the region maximum.
